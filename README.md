# About-me
- I'm an applied physics major looking into photonic computing
- I am interested in algorithms, data analysis, machine learning/deep learning, and anything to do with physics ⚛️
- My main language is python but I also have experience in SQL, CSS, HTML, and C++
- I need to learn Matlab sometime I guess 🤷‍♂️
